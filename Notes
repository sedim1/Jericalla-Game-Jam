walls ar 90 degres
walls are cubes 
floor is alway flat

Projection attributes - defined by us
 Player height can be defined here by us or by wallheight / 2
 FOV = how wide the player sees the world in front of him 
 Player pos

Projection plane = basically our screen, part f our screen, you can see it as the window size of the camera
projectionPlaneWidth will define how many columns are going to be drawn on the  screen


 
RelationShip between player and projection plane
distanceFrom player to ProjectionPlane = (PROJECTION_PLANE_WIDTH/2)/tan(FOV/2) 

Angle between subsequent rays = FOV / PROJECTION_PLANE_WIDTH
